# ðŸ‘‰What is Fab Academy?

## The Global Classroom
Fab Academy consists of both classes **online and offline disciplines**, a method which we call "distributed education". Students work on two levels - global and local. The global level, otherwise known as the Global Campus, connects a total of 250 students enrolled in Fab Academy in more than 50 cities worldwide. The students connect weekly for Global Lectures with Professor Neil Gershenfeld - Director of MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms. After every Global Lecture, in which Prof. Gershenfeld explains the content and lays out the assignment for the week, there is a round of reviews that opens the possibility for students to interact with the rest of the global community.

**The Fab Academy program** is based on MITâ€™s popular rapid-prototyping course **â€˜How To Make (Almost) Anything** - both courses are taught by Prof. Neil Gershenfeld. The Fab Academy Diploma is awarded by the Fab Academy community with the support of the Fab Lab Network and Fab Foundation. In the past years, numerous institutions hosting the course have started accrediting the skills developed in the course - you can check these institutions here. 

*In specific cases such as mine, we do not obtain a diploma. We take the programme with lower requirements as part of the Master in Design for Emergent Futures programme. Anyways this repository is a showcase for the work we do.*

# ðŸ‘‰A (local) Digital Fabrication Playground

**Once enrolled in Fab Academy you will learn how to use the Fab Labâ€™s digital fabrication tools, machines and skills such as: Project management, Computer design, Computer-controlled cutting, Electronics, 3D scanning and printing, Electronics design, Computer-controlled machining, Embedded programming, Molding and casting, Networking and communications, Mechanical design, Interface and application programming and Machine design. In addition to the Global Lectures, there are two days each week where you will receive specific support for your project and have access to Fab Lab Barcelonaâ€™s workshop and digital fabrication equipment.**

By the end of the course, you will have the essential knowledge to plan, develop and prototype a final project. You will also have a comprehensive understanding of how to plan a sustainable business and how to share cutting-edge designs in an open-source environment.

The course is delivered in collaboration with students from the **IAAC Master of Design for Emergent Futures**, this provides an excellent opportunity to expand professional and personal experiences. Previous Alumni of the program have used the future-skills gained to build leading roles in the global Fab Lab network, established their own design studios and have also become entrepreneurs in the innovation and social design fields.

# ðŸ’»what are you going to find in this repository?

The documentation of the course:

- **Project management**
*Introduction to the tools that will be used in the course (version control, web development, project management, etc tools) and project management principles. Getting through a GitLab!*

- **Computer-aided design**
*Covering all the possibilities for 2D and 3D software, tools and formats. You will start sketching your Final Project.*

- **Computer-controlled cutting**
*You will get acquainted with cutting possibilities; CAD & CAM intro; Vinyl cutter and Laser cutter introduction and exercise.*

- **Electronics production**
*First steps into electronics production. We start with PCB (Printed Circuit Board) description and production.*

- **3D scanning and printing**
*You will get an introduction to additive vs subtractive processes and learn 3D printing processes, material, machines, formats and software. Also, 3D scanning tools and machines.*

- **Electronics design**
*Keeping up with the electronic production, you will get an introduction to components, circuits and testing equipment.*

- **Computer-controlled machining**
*You will get an introduction to projects, machines, materials, tools and more, to then design, mil and assemble something big!*

- **Embedded programming**
*Learning the essentials of programming small computers (microcontrollers) to drive devices and program your board.*

- **Molding and casting**
*Learn to design and produce molds to then test castings of objects and parts.*

- **Input and Output devices**
*You will broaden the possibilities of your microcontroller board by adding hardware to capture data, and to send data to another device or user.*

- **Applications and implications**
*Why to design? And why to make rather than buy? The impact of our practice.*

- **Networking and communications**
*Data transmission through wired or wireless media.*

- **Interface and application programming**
*You will get the necessary tools to write an application that interfaces a user with the input &/or output device that you made.*

- **Wildcard week**
*For this assignment, you will be asked to design and produce something of your choice, with a digital fabrication process not covered in previous assignments (composites, textiles, biotechnology, robotics, folding, and cookingâ€¦)*

- **Invention, intellectual property, and income**
*An introduction to key concepts that will help you bring your projects or product to the market.*
